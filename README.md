# LOADING_PLAN
I created an application for automatically launching workflows in the Informatica PowerCenter. In the application, you can set parameters for running workflows.
To expand the functionality, you can set the dependencies for the date or time / completion of other workflows / completion of plan activities. 
Also, there is monitoring of working in the application .
